TESTING_INTERVAL = "5"

# SECURITY WARNING
# ================
#
# Unfortunately, syslog and rsyslog allow end-users to log messages to some
# system logs via the same unix socket that other local services use. This 
# means that any log line shown in these system logs that syslog or rsyslog
# maintain can be spoofed (they are exactly the same as real log lines).
#
# Since some of the features of lfd rely on such log lines, spoofed messages
# can cause false-positive matches which can lead to confusion at best, or
# blocking of any innocent IP address or making the server inaccessible at
# worst.
#
# Any option that relies on the log entries in the files listed in
# /etc/syslog.conf and /etc/rsyslog.conf should therefore be considered
# vulnerable to exploitation by end-users and scripts run by end-users.
#
# NOTE: Not all log files are affected as they may not use syslog/rsyslog
#
# The option RESTRICT_SYSLOG disables all these features that rely on affected
# logs. These options are:
# LF_SSHD LF_FTPD LF_IMAPD LF_POP3D LF_BIND LF_SUHOSIN LF_SSH_EMAIL_ALERT
# LF_SU_EMAIL_ALERT LF_CONSOLE_EMAIL_ALERT LF_DISTATTACK LF_DISTFTP
# LT_POP3D LT_IMAPD PS_INTERVAL UID_INTERVAL WEBMIN_LOG LF_WEBMIN_EMAIL_ALERT
# PORTKNOCKING_ALERT
#
# This list of options use the logs but are not disabled by RESTRICT_SYSLOG:
# ST_ENABLE SYSLOG_CHECK LOGSCANNER CUSTOM*_LOG
#
# The following options are still enabled by default on new installations so
# that, on balance, csf/lfd still provides expected levels of security:
# LF_SSHD LF_FTPD LF_POP3D LF_IMAPD LF_SSH_EMAIL_ALERT LF_SU_EMAIL_ALERT
#
# If you set RESTRICT_SYSLOG to "0" or "2" and enable any of the options listed
# above, it should be done with the knowledge that any of the those options
# that are enabled could be triggered by spoofed log lines and lead to the
# server being inaccessible in the worst case. If you do not want to take that
# risk you should set RESTRICT_SYSLOG to "1" and those features will not work
# but you will not be protected from the exploits that they normally help block
#
# The recommended setting for RESTRICT_SYSLOG is "3" to restrict who can access
# the syslog/rsyslog unix socket.
#
# For further advice on how to help mitigate these issues, see
# /etc/csf/readme.txt
#
# 0 = Allow those options listed above to be used and configured

# to a unique name for the server
#
# You can add users to this group by changing /etc/csf/csf.syslogusers and then
# restarting lfd afterwards. This will create the system group and add the
# users from csf.syslogusers if they exist to that group and will change the
# permissions on the syslog/rsyslog unix socket(s). The socket(s) will be
# monitored and the permissions re-applied should syslog/rsyslog be restarted
#
# Using this option will prevent some legitimate logging, e.g. end-user cron
